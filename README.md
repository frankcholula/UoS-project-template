# University of Surrey Assigmment Template Repository ðŸ¦Œ
Hello! This is a template repository for all the assignments in the CVRML course of the University of Surrey.
Feel free to use this repository as a starting template for your assignments. Cheers.


## LaTeX Setup
This comes with a University of Surrey Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences thesis template created by Aaron and Alireza on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/surrey-feps-confirmation-report-template/kffgbyxwcrbg). I recommend setting up a local distribution of Tex Live on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).

Explicit instruction on running Tex Live with vscode can be found [here](https://mathjiajia.github.io/vscode-and-latex/).
